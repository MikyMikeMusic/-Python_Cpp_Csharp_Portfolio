# Summary of Computer Architecture

• Binary Conversions and Operations: Includes methods for converting between binary and decimal numbers, and for performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on binary numbers.
• Cache Management: Implements a simple cache with limited capacity, demonstrating the concept of data storage and retrieval.
• Logic Gate Simulation: Offers a function to simulate the output of various logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) and NOT.
• Instruction Set Simulation: Contains a method to simulate the execution of instructions in RISC and CISC architectures, based on a simple set of opcodes.
• High-Level to Machine Code Conversion: Presents a method for converting high-level instructions into binary machine code, based on a predefined mapping.
• Data-Level Parallelism: Introduces a method simd_vector_addition to simulate parallel vector addition, reflecting the concept of SIMD architectures.
